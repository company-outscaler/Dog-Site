# React + Vite

# Bootstrap Integration to React
Bootstrap is integrated into this project to provide a responsive design and grid system. You can add Bootstrap classes directly to your React components for styling, or customize it further using SCSS if needed.

This project aims to integrate Bootstrap into a React environment using Vite for a fast and optimized workflow. We converted traditional Bootstrap components into React-compatible components to leverage React's component-based architecture.

# Project Goals
1.Use Vite for a faster build and development process.
2.Integrate Bootstrap CSS into React.
3.Convert Bootstrap components (e.g., Navbars, Buttons, Forms) into React components  # 4.4 using React-Bootstrap or custom approaches.
5.Maintain a responsive design using Bootstrap's grid system.
